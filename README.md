Hi, I made a copy of hl1 in honor of the 25th anniversary of the half-life game. will the files be updated? NO, I don't want to update the game files when the patch was released in honor of the 25th anniversary. the source code of the 25th anniversary of the game was released for the sake of whom people need to play in the future.
